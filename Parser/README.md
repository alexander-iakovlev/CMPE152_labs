# Pascal Scanner

To run our project, first build the code by running:
``` make ```

And run the parser:
``` ./parser ```

Note that the deafault input file should be named "test-in.txt", located in the same directory as the parser executable.
Default output file will be named "test-out.txt", in the same directory as "test-in.txt".
